This is a Responsive landing page that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. 
The navigation menu have a fixed position and are visible on all pages. 
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

~Prominent buttons encourage users to "Get Started" or "Learn More," guiding user interaction effectively.
~Buttons have hover effects with smooth transitions for better interactivity.
